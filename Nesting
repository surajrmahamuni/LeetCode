Question:

A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:

S is empty;
S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int solution(String S) {
       
       int left_counter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            if (c == '(') {
                left_counter++;
            } else {
                left_counter--;
                if (left_counter < 0) return 0;
            }
        }
        if (left_counter == 0) return 1;
        return 0;

    }
}

Time Complexity: O(N)
